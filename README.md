# dd-scalable-walls
Resize walls by height or width independently.

# Notes
Any walls which are scaled by this mod will have their textures changed to wood
if you open the map with the mod disabled. To fix this, enable the mod and use
the "Reset Scale" button on each wall before disabling it again. This will
restore the original textures.
